"""Second exercise: Capitalize the first letter of all the words in a text.
Create a program with the following functions:
    - "readTxtFile", that reads a text file and memorize all the lines in a list
    - "capitalizeWords", that capitalizes the first letter of each word in each line and save the result in a new list
    - "writeTxtFile", that write the capitalized text in a new text file
Test the program using the file "loremipsum.txt" and write the result is "loremipsum_cap.txt"
NOTE: Try to avoid capitalize(), other useful methods to modify strings are split(), upper(), join()
